# Logo Generation Prompts for Plunge

These prompts are designed for high-end generative AI models like **Midjourney v6**, **DALL-E 3**, or **Stable Diffusion XL**. They capture the "Liquid Glass" and "Aquatic Minimalism" aesthetic of the Plunge design system.

## Option 1: The Deep Portal (Geometric & Abstract)
*Focuses on the "Plunge" concept—looking straight down into deep water. Best for a clean, iconic app icon.*

> **Prompt:** A minimalist app icon design for a luxury pool control app. A perfect top-down view of a deep circular pool of water glowing with bioluminescent cyan light. The water is encased in a dark, matte black circular frame. Subtle concentric ripples radiate from the center, rendered in high-fidelity glass texture. The style is "Liquid Glass Futurism"—combining the aesthetics of Apple Vision Pro interface design with deep water. Volumetric lighting, caustic water reflections, deep teal and cyan palette against a void black background. 8k resolution, 3d render, octane render, architectural minimalism. --ar 1:1 --v 6.0

## Option 2: The Glass Drop (Sculptural & Tactile)
*Focuses on the "Water Drop" concept but elevated to a piece of jewelry or glass art.*

> **Prompt:** A macro close-up of a single, perfect sphere of liquid cyan glass hovering in a dark void. The sphere captures the essence of a water drop but is perfectly geometric. Inside the sphere, complex light refraction and deep water caustics are visible. The sphere casts a soft, glowing cyan light onto a dark, frosted glass surface below it. Minimalist, premium, tactile. The aesthetic is "Refined Futurism." Sharp focus, depth of field, raytracing, unreal engine 5 style. --ar 1:1 --v 6.0

## Option 3: The Interface (Tech-Forward & Sleek)
*Focuses on the "Smart Home" aspect—looking like a physical button or high-end device.*

> **Prompt:** A minimalist top-down view of a single circular app icon. The icon is a solid, 3D circle of polished obsidian glass with a high-gloss "liquid glass" finish. Carved deep into the dark surface is a circular groove or channel (a ring) that does not reach the edges. Inside this deep recess sits a glowing vein of electric cyan liquid. This liquid features the texture of "Deep Water Caustics"—shimmering and refracting light like a jewel made of frozen pool water. The center of the button is dark obsidian, framed by this deep, glowing blue trench. The lighting is moody and dramatic, accentuating the depth of the channel and the 3D curvature of the black glass. Isolated on a pure white background with NO shadow and NO cast shadow. Apple design aesthetic meets Cyberpunk luxury. Ultra-realistic, 8k, centered composition, flat vector-like geometry but with photorealistic 3D materials. --ar 1:1 --v 6.0

## Option 4: The Ripple (Organic & Fluid)
*Focuses on the movement of water frozen in time.*

> **Prompt:** An abstract logo symbol representing a water ripple. Created entirely from layers of translucent, dark blue and cyan glass. The layers overlap to create depth and varying opacity. The center is a bright, piercing cyan light source that fades into deep indigo at the edges. Minimalist vector art style interpreted through 3D glass rendering. Clean lines, perfect geometry, smooth gradients. No background details, just the object floating in darkness. --ar 1:1 --v 6.0

## Option 5: The Caustic Prism (Light & Refraction)
*Focuses on the beautiful light patterns on the bottom of a pool.*

> **Prompt:** A square app icon with rounded corners. The texture is "Deep Water Caustics." A mesmerizing pattern of light refracting through clear blue water onto a dark surface. The light patterns form a vague, abstract circular shape in the center. The color palette is strictly deep midnight blue and vibrant electric cyan. It looks like a jewel made of frozen pool water. High contrast, sharp details, cinematic lighting, photorealistic texture. --ar 1:1 --v 6.0

## Recommended Settings (if using Midjourney)
- `--v 6.0` (Use the latest version)
- `--stylize 250` (Keep it artistic but respectful of the prompt)
- `--style raw` (If you want it less "painted" and more photographic/design-focused)
